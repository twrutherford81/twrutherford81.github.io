## Algorithms and Data Structures

### Description:

For the Algorithms and Data Structures category, the original artifact was enhanced and translated from Java to C# for use in the full-stack application. This file was created in 2025 as part of my capstone project to transform the command-line Java implementation into a full-stack C# application. The artifact uses the Boyer Moore Search algorithm to efficiently search data for a given pattern.

### Justification:

The Boyer Moore Search algorithm was chosen because of its optimization though the “bad character” and “good suffix heuristics,” its O(m*n) time complexity, and its efficiency in real world use cases. The original artifact demonstrated the power of the algorithm but was not packaged for usability. Therefore, the algorithm was converted to C# for integration into the full-state States Search program. Additionally, the algorithm use was modified to fit the needs of the new user flow in the application. These enhancements demonstrate my ability to convert and adapt existing software for use in other environments. 

### Reflection:

During the conversion process from Java to C#, I discovered that the programming language structures are quite similar. For example, conditional statements, variable declaration, and class structure are the same. Naturally, the built-in libraries and functions are different between the two, but the conversion went smooth because the syntax was so similar. I have had to convert Visual Basic to a C style language before and that was not as straight forward. 
  
The greatest challenge with this enhancement was learning the nuances of the C# programming language. For example, C# uses name spaces where Java uses packages. Although, similar in syntax to Java, it was necessary for me to refer to the C# documentation several times to determine the proper syntax for an action.
