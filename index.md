Hello, and welcome to my ePortfolio. My name is Tom and I have been working as a software engineer for over 15 years. I have a passion for developing programs that make the computer work for people. I received an AS degree in Computer Information Systems shortly after high school and returned to school in 2023 to complete a BS in Computer Science. This site contains details of the capstone project completed as part of the BS degree.

## Professional Self Assessment

### Software Engineering Skills
The Computer Science program at SNHU has strengthened my software engineering foundation and equipped me with the necessary skills and tools to succeed as a software engineer in the ever-evolving world of software development. I have learned how to write efficient and maintainable code that aligns with best practices and have been fully equipped in all aspects of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This includes requirements gathering and analysis, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Furthermore, I have been trained how to integrate security best practices into every phase of the SDLC using principles such as security by design, defense-in-depth, least privilege, and zero-trust.

### Professional Communication and Team Collaboration
In addition to technical skills, I have also developed professional communication  and team collaboration abilities. Demonstration of these skills is shown through my contributions to code documentation, oral code reviews, version control commits, and project documents. The combination of technical and soft skills forms the foundation for me to professionally communicate with stakeholders and deliver an end-product that meets their needs. Evidence of these abilities and others can be found throughout the content in this portfolio. For instance, some of the solutions provided are:

-	A comprehensive code review highlighting issues and recommendations for improvement
-	Development of a full-stack PC application
-	Implementing data structures and algorithms for maximum efficiency
-	Designing databases and the supporting infrastructure
-	Thorough documentation using code comments and README files

### Professional Accomplishments
Aside from the content displayed in this portfolio, there have been several accomplishments throughout my career and education of which I am proud. The development efforts I am most proud of are:

-	A full-stack PC program for hospital staff to test specific medical equipment
-	Android applications for use in the medical environment deployed via Google Play
-	Integrate OTA update functionality into a custom AOSP build

### Personal Reflection
The education and experiences throughout the course of the Computer Science program have had a significant impact on my decision to continue my career as a software development professional. I am confident that I can work and thrive in any software environment because of the exposure to the various software architectures received at SNHU. The solutions I have developed range from simple scripting applications in Python to full-stack applications using architectures like the MEAN stack and Microsoftâ€™s .NET framework. Although I have not worked with every architecture, I have learned how to quickly become familiar with new development environments and adapt to their nuances. I have come to appreciate the challenge of new and diverse project opportunities because I know it will help me to grow as a software engineer.

### Portfolio Overview
The code contained in this portfolio shows my ability to transform an existing command-line based search algorithm into a full-stack PC application with an integrated cloud-based database and CI/CD support. The original artifact and a selection of the enhanced artifacts are available for view using the links below.
