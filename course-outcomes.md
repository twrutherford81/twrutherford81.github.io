# Course Outcomes - TODO: fill in content

This page details how my work meets the course outcomes for the SNHU BS in Computer Science capstone. See below for mapping and explanations.

## Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science
- Does the student demonstrate the ability to use interaction to create code-review experiences?
- Does the student demonstrate the ability to understand code reviews individually and within a team environment?
- Does the student demonstrate the ability to provide contextual, in-code comments that result in easily readable and understandable code?
- Does the student demonstrate the ability to support decision making for software design stakeholders?
- Does the student demonstrate the ability to discuss experiences and best practices working in collaborative environments?

## Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts
- Does the student demonstrate the ability to communicate a code review effectively through collaborative environments?
- Does the student demonstrate the ability to discuss experiences and best practices in communication?
- Does the student demonstrate the ability to communicate appropriately to specific audiences and contexts?
- Does the student demonstrate the ability to clearly convey their ideas and explain their thought process through written, visual, or oral communication?

## Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices
- Does the student demonstrate the ability to use pseudocode to segment functionality in software and make design trades?
- Does the student demonstrate the ability to program solutions to solve logic problems and implement them in software?
- Does the student demonstrate the ability to clearly articulate approaches to solving complex logic problems inherent software?

## Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals
- Does the student demonstrate the ability to employ iterative testing techniques in the code?
- Does the student demonstrate the ability to use the software development life cycle to create realistic production schedules for software projects?
- Does the student demonstrate the ability to create industry-standard software designs?
- Does the student discuss experiences and best practices in using well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices?
- Does the student create more robust and efficient code to deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals?

## Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources
- Does the student demonstrate the ability to address potential design flaws in software architecture during the requirements phase?
- Does the student demonstrate the ability to find and eradicate security vulnerabilities or bugs?
- Does the student demonstrate the ability to define an approach that ensures all data are explicitly validated?
- Does the student demonstrate the ability to consider future changes to objects and classes?
- Does the student demonstrate the ability to discuss experiences and best practices in developing a security mindset?
